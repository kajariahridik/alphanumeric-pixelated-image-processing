# alphanumeric-pixelated-image-processing
this project is based on decoding a single line encoded alphanumeric image, followed by different image processing without the use of standard libraries.


Download the MATLAB file and text file in the same folder. Run the .m file to get the results.

Modify the pixelated image grid size to experiment.
